      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I discovered the writing and work of Steph Ango. Steph is the CEO of Obsidian, has a background in biology and industrial design, and has some really interesting ideas around design, consumption, and creativity that I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed diving into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hosts a blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://stephango.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the Dialectic podcast from Notion has a great long-form &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5RDXPYjvNWqK933eHQNhHP&#34;&gt;interview with Steph&lt;/a&gt; about how he views work, building teams, products, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I really appreciated about Steph was his clear and concise communication around the values (in my own words now) of building with intentionality and not for markets, consumption of goods that don&amp;rsquo;t consume you, and stripping away unnecessary complexity. Below are some highlights from that interview along with some articles of his that I resonated with. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
