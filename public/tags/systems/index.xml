&lt;p&gt;Getting under the hood of database implementations is becoming an area of growing interest for me. Early in my career, I was always content with SQL as an interface to a datastore that &amp;ldquo;just works.&amp;rdquo; That is, until it doesn&amp;rsquo;t anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s at those points that I am now being pushed to understand why a particular database implementation has certain behavioral characteristics in different circumstances. Further, I have never crossed paths with a professional DBA and often feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a whole sphere of mystery for me here. As I plunge these depths for the first time, however, I find many of the same interesting aspects of design and layering that have made K8s of interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am getting to the stage of my career now where I have started picking up guiding principles that guide my socio-technical endeavors. I am sure I will continue to learn more and add them here or come back revise these with more wisdom and insight but what I want to start here is a collection of tenets. These tenets are not implementation details or design patterns but are more like paradigms for how we relate to problems, the natural systems that emerge from people thrown into teams, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
