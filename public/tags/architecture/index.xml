&lt;p&gt;Getting under the hood of database implementations is becoming an area of growing interest for me. Early in my career, I was always content with SQL as an interface to a datastore that &amp;ldquo;just works.&amp;rdquo; That is, until it doesn&amp;rsquo;t anymore. It&amp;rsquo;s at those points that I am now being pushed to understand why a particular database implementation has certain behavioral characteristics in different circumstances. Further, I have never crossed paths with a professional DBA and often feel like there&amp;rsquo;s a whole sphere of mystery for me here. As I plunge these depths for the first time, however, I find many of the same interesting aspects of design and layering that have made K8s of interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I have been studying more systems desing more intentionally lately and this is the fruit of one evening of diagramming out a URL Shortner design. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain much but a picture&amp;rsquo;s worth a thousand words!
